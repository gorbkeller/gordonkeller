        My name is Gordon Keller. I am a PhD Candidate at UC Santa Cruz (about to finish, fingers crossed!).
        My thesis research involves the use and development of high-grade payloads for Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS, or drones) and implementing system autonomy primarily related to deployment for geoscientific research.
        I specialize in UAS proprioception, primarily by implementing different sensing techniques (e.g., visual SLAM, object recognition, etc.) and hope to apply these skills towards my dream of starting a non-profit. More information about that is <a href="non-profit-info.htm">here</a>.
        After a few years interacting with drones academically, I decided to take the plunge into them as a hobby. This evolved into professional operation primarily through disc golf (course flyovers).
        This work has been exciting and taken me places I never would have expected.
        The best part is the wealth of connections to different people from various walks of life it has facilitated.<br><br>

        Please <a href="contact.htm">contact me</a> if you are interested in my services! My <a href="rates.htm">rates</a> are incredibly reasonable for the high-quality work that I do as can be seen in my <a href="projects">recent projects</a>.<br><br>
        
        I also do volunteer work using my equipment for humanitarian efforts, especially Search And Rescue (SAR). If you or someone you know is looking for someone they love, please contact me ASAP and I will do my best to help.<br><br>

        Thank you, and I hope you have a wonderful day! - Gordon Keller
