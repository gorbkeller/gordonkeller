                    <h4>Initial thoughts</h4>
                    <p>
                    I am, as so many others are, transfixed by Geometric Algebra (GA).
                    It isn't that I truly understand (or can even begin to understand?) the
                    power of this Algebra, nor is it a belief that I will
                    need this sometime in the future. It might be that a part of me recognizes
                    a certain intuitiveness to or profoundness of it all, but I'm unconvinved
                    that that is why I keep finding myself coming back to it. Decoding the 
                    significance or usefulness of it, I'm coming to find, is a difficult task
                    for me. Not in the, 'This is hard -- I'll keep working at it,' manner of
                    thinking, but instead the distorted and counter-productive, 'Ow, my brain
                    -- I must be dumb,' flavor.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>
                    <p>
                    This is why I am now publishing some of my self-study thoughts in this
                    blog. I want to combat the idea that I will never have a command of this
                    material, and the more transparent I am with where I am at in the journey,
                    the easier it might become to have patience in the face of what seem like
                    insurmountable confusion. The self-judgement I harbor around my intellect
                    or capacity to solve problems is insideous and tries to wedge itself between
                    my current state and my potential for growth.<br>

                    My hope is that by briefly outlining some of my thoughts on the subject
                    matter in a public way, the confidence in my abilities to synthesize complex
                    or unfamiliar topics will be bolstered. Also, if this was a conduit for
                    discussion on the subject matter with someone who stumbles upon this, I
                    would be immensely grateful. There are not many people in my life currently
                    who care to talk about this kind of thing (though sometimes someone will
                    indulge me and let me try out my half-baked notions on them)

                    </p>
